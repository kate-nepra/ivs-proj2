While doing a profiling we came to multiple conclusions. 
The places where our program took the most time varied drastically with different amount of input data. 

Program with 10 and 100 inputs spend most of the time doing system and internal functions.
In order to make it better we can optimize the code to contain the least amount of external functions and modules.

Profiling with 1000 inputs showed us, that our program spends most of the time in two sections. 
In a function, that reads data from input and in function, that does calculations with the read numbers.

Specifically the most time was spend in a build-in function input() and in functions addition() and multiplication() from our math_lib library.
This is caused because these functions are called very often.
If we want to optimize our program, we should focus on finding more efficient ways to read numbers and calculate with them.
